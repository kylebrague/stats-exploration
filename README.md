# Stat Exploration: TTRPG Dice Rolling and Fantasy Baseball Predictions

Welcome to the README file for my stat exploration project! In this project, I will be diving into two fascinating areas: TTRPG (Tabletop Role-Playing Game) dice rolling and fantasy baseball predictions. 

## TTRPG Dice Rolling
In the TTRPG dice rolling section, I will be analyzing various dice rolling mechanics used in popular role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder, and more. I will explore the probabilities, distributions, and statistical outcomes of different dice rolls, helping players and game masters make informed decisions during gameplay.

## Fantasy Baseball Predictions
In the fantasy baseball predictions section, I will be leveraging statistical analysis techniques to make accurate predictions for fantasy baseball leagues. By analyzing player performance data, historical trends, and other relevant factors, I aim to provide insights and strategies for fantasy baseball enthusiasts to gain a competitive edge in their leagues.
